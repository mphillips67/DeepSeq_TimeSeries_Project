SNP table and output from regression scripts are required.

Scripts used for SOM analysis described in "Increased time sampling in an evolve-and-resequence experiment with outcrossing Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals multiple paths of adaptive change".

Rand_SOM* scripts generate data matrixes containing random collections of SNPs, and Sig_SOM* scripts generates matrixes for our singificant SNPs based on regression analysis results.

SOM_Plots.R is used in conjuction with those tables to run SOM analysis.
