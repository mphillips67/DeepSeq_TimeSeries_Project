SNP table and output from regression scripts are required to run SOM analysis.

Rand_SOM* scripts generate data matrixes containing random collections of SNPs, and Sig_SOM* scripts generates matrixes for our singificant SNPs based on regression analysis results.

SOM_Plots.R is used in conjuction with those tables to run SOM analysis.
